// suppose we donâ€™t know where we are pointing to, we can use a null pointer.
// nullptr is a new keyword introduced in C++11. It provides a typesafe pointer value repsenting an empty pointer.
// In older C/C++ code, NULL was used for this purpose. nullptr is meant as a modern replacement to NULL.

    int *ptr = nullptr;

    // Later in the program...
